RU Studying
Problem: Finding study buddies or location spots that are not taken.
Main Idea: A web app that shows both study locations and itâ€™s availability


One will be able to request their study spot be added
Have a similar setup to bus apps, but being able to click on buildings and then show availability (this availability info will be given from users because no other way to find it) maybe base it off bus business too ?
